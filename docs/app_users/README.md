Locate the Project Folder: Find the folder where you've downloaded the Flask application on your computer. 

Run the Frontend by navigating to the frontend folder. Make sure you are running the following commands in the frontend folder - 

```javascript
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, Install Dependencies: Look for a file named requirements.txt in the project folder. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run - 


```python
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

After the installation is completed, run 
```python
python app.py
```
Or, click on the run button on the top right corner of the window to run the app. 

Once both frontend and backend are up, click on the link shown in the frontend terminal to open the app in the browser.
Or, navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
